# projecct overview
This project are pages of text that allow me to express how I define community. I had used a poem written by Beck Klassen:

"Here is a story I tell myself,
When I remeber my blessings:
You can be kind,
You can be present with people, and
Know that you don't know what their lives are like.
You can do little things
To make them feel better.
You can get to know them
By listening and not judging.
Being isolated has been difficuly,
But I am grounded in the knowledge
That we can be kind." -Beck Klassen

The word community makes me think about how a person can be apart of many communities at once built off relationships with others. Specifically for me, I think about the community of my culture, which are Chinese traditions/family, my group of friends, my coworkers, and my boyfriend. They're all part of a different community that I value becuase of the efforts I put to create relationships with these groups of people. It means a safe place for me with the people I enjoy being around, whether that is one person, a group of people, or just by myself.

# technical overview
I decided to keep it simple on the first page. I chose to use tranform and translated it 20em to the right to show that it's going to the next page, and added an aura like background with teal and copper color.

On the second page, I wanted the word kind to pop up and take center of attention to emphasize it. So I  created an annimation with a duration of 5 seconds with a scale of 2 and tranlated to 15em. I added a final touch of a pink, light pink, and vanilla color gradient as the background.

For page three, I created a radial background and targeted the circular part to be close to the word present, so that I could emphasize it. I also scaled the word present to 2 and tranlated it to -5em.
