This project are pages of text that allow me to express how I define community. I had used a poem written by Beck Klassen:

"Here is a story I tell myself,
When I remeber my blessings:
You can be kind,
You can be present with people, and
Know that you don't know what their lives are like.
You can do little things
To make them feel better.
You can get to know them
By listening and not judging.
Being isolated has been difficuly,
But I am grounded in the knowledge
That we can be kind." -Beck Klassen

The word community makes me think about how a person can be apart of many communities at once built off relationships with others. Specifically for me, I think about the community of my culture, which are Chinese traditions/family, my group of friends, my coworkers, and my boyfriend. They're all part of a different community that I value becuase of the efforts I put to create relationships with these groups of people. It means a safe place for me with the people I enjoy being around, whether that is one person, a group of people, or just by myself.
